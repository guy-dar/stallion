## Utilities
Utilities are useful blocks of code shared by the entire code base. They are needed for cleaner and modular code across the rest of the code base. Also, it supports compatibility by abstracting away implementation details related to browser(version) compatibility.

Several functionalities are provided by `utils`:

* **page_utils.js**: Useful as general interface to locations on the page and its intricate structure.

* **text.js**: Useful for textual manipulation, needed by downstream tasks as find heuristics.
